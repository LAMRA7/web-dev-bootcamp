# Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python

Thank you for checking out the course code!

Access the course notes here: https://python-web.teclado.com

## Contributing

Install Python requirements with Pipenv:

```
pipenv install
```

Then use `pre-commit` to set up the Python formatter hooks (this will run Black on any Python files before you commit):

```
pipenv shell
pre-commit install
```

Then, set up the Vuepress project:

```
npm install
```

That should install everything!

## Run

To run the project, you can just do:

```
npm run cur:dev
```
