## Contributing

Install Python requirements with Pipenv:

```
pipenv install
```

Then use `pre-commit` to set up the Python formatter hooks (this will run Black on any Python files before you commit):

```
pipenv shell
pre-commit install
```

Then, set up the Vuepress project:

```
yarn
```

That should install everything!

## Run

To run the project, you can just do:

```
yarn cur:dev
```
