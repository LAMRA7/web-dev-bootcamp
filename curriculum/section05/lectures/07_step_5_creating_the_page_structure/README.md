# Step 5: Creating the Page Structure

- Visualizing the structure of the page roughly
  - We'll formalize this a bit better when we do the HTML code
- It helps greatly if you're familiar with HTML, because you'll know more or less what can go where and how elements behave by default
- Things we're looking for:
  - Layouts (grids vs. columns vs. rows)
  - Nesting of elements
  - Type of elements if possible
