# Step 6: Coding the Page Structure

Finally, we can code the page structure and transfer all our thoughts into HTML.

In programming, and I find especially in HTML, there's no _one way to do things_. Everyone that codes in HTML finds a slightly different way to do the same thing: be that the nesting of elements, or the tags used, the class names, or really anything else.

That's OK! Over time you'll learn more and come up with simpler HTML code that achieves the same outcome.

- HTML boilerplate: DOCTYPE, html, head, body, meta tags, title
- Overall page structure
- What elements go in which
