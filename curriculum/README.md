# What is this course?

Welcome to the Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python! Thank you for embarking in this journey with me.

In this course, you'll learn how to develop complete web applications using HTML, CSS, Flask, and MongoDB. You'll learn to get user data and return dynamic pages, and you'll learn how to deploy and share your applications with users.

Through building projects, you'll master HTML and CSS, and you'll extend their capabilities with Jinja2.

For backend development you'll use Python with the Flask framework, and MongoDB as a database.

Here are the projects you'll build:

- About me page
- Microblog
- Habit tracker
- Portfolio page
- Movie watchlist

Each one builds upon all the knowledge you'll have gained up to that point, getting increasingly large and complex. Due to how the course is structured though, you'll never be confused!

Every lecture of the course has its corresponding page in this e-book, where you can find notes and code.

Let's get started!
